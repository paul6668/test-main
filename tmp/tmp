If the user's attribute as the member of a group is different from the user's DN, you must specify this parameter. For example, if a user's DN is uid=bob,ou=people,o=starrocks,dc=com, but its attribute as a group member is memberUid=bob,ou=people,o=starrocks,dc=com, you need to specify ldap_user_search_attr as uid and ldap_user_group_match_attr as memberUid. If this parameter is not specified, the value you specified in ldap_user_search_attr is used. You can also specify a regular expression to match the members in the group. The regular expression must be prefixed by regex:. Suppose a group has a member CN=Poornima K Hebbar (phebbar),OU=User Policy 0,OU=All Users,DC=SEA,DC=CORP,DC=EXPECN,DC=com. If you specify this property as regex:CN=.*\\(([^)]+)\\), it will match the member phebbar.

RKE2 provides the Kubernetes orchestration layer that manages containerized applications, networking, and scaling. It is the foundation for running workloads like ingress controllers, CNI plugins, and storage solutions.

4. Ingress - NGINX
Description
NGINX is a widely used ingress controller that provides load balancing, SSL termination, and routing for Kubernetes services.

Key Features
Traffic Management: Routes external traffic to internal Kubernetes services.
SSL/TLS Support: Handles SSL termination and certificate management.
Custom Rules: Supports advanced configurations like rewrite rules and rate limiting.
High Performance: Optimized for handling large volumes of traffic.
Role in the Architecture
NGINX ingress controller manages external access to Kubernetes services and ensures secure and efficient traffic routing. It integrates with Cert-Manager for SSL certificate automation.

5. CNI - Cilium, WireGuard, and Egress
Description
Cilium, WireGuard, and Egress form the networking stack for the Kubernetes cluster, providing connectivity, security, and traffic control.

Key Features
Cilium: Offers advanced networking, security policies, and observability for Kubernetes workloads.
WireGuard: Provides encrypted communication between nodes for secure networking.
Egress: Controls outbound traffic from the cluster, ensuring compliance with security policies.
Role in the Architecture
The CNI plugins ensure secure and efficient networking within and outside the Kubernetes cluster. Cilium handles service-to-service communication, WireGuard encrypts node communication, and Egress manages outbound traffic.

6. Cert-Manager
Description
Cert-Manager is a Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates.

Key Features
Certificate Automation: Automatically provisions and renews certificates for applications like Ingress and Minio.
ACME Support: Integrates with Let's Encrypt and other certificate authorities.
Custom Issuers: Supports self-signed certificates and enterprise CAs.
Integration: Works seamlessly with NGINX Ingress and HashiCorp Vault.
Role in the Architecture
Cert-Manager simplifies certificate management for secure communication between services. It ensures that components like NGINX Ingress and Minio have valid and up-to-date certificates.

7. HashiCorp Vault
Description
HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool that provides secure storage and dynamic credential generation.

Key Features
Dynamic Secrets: Generates database credentials on demand for Enterprise DB.
Encryption: Stores secrets securely using strong encryption algorithms.
Access Control: Integrates with Kubernetes RBAC for fine-grained access control.
Audit Logs: Tracks all secret access and usage for compliance.
Role in the Architecture
Vault manages sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and certificates. It dynamically generates credentials for Enterprise DB to enhance security and minimize risks.

8. Database as a Service - Enterprise DB
Description
Enterprise DB (EDB) is a robust, scalable, and enterprise-grade database solution.

Key Features
High Availability: Supports clustering and replication for fault tolerance.
Performance Optimization: Includes advanced indexing and query optimization.
Security: Integrates with HashiCorp Vault for dynamic credential management.
Kubernetes Integration: Can be deployed as a StatefulSet for persistence.
Role in the Architecture
Enterprise DB serves as the primary database for applications running in the Kubernetes cluster. It integrates with Vault for secure credential management and provides reliable data storage.

9. CICD - Tekton + ArgoCD
Description

To run a Dagster data pipeline on Kubernetes (K8s), you'll need to follow several key steps that involve setting up the necessary infrastructure and configuring Dagster to work within a Kubernetes environment. Here's a general guide to help you get started:

### 1. **Set up Kubernetes Cluster**

Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster, either on a cloud provider (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS) or locally (e.g., using Minikube or Kind). Ensure `kubectl` is configured and working to interact with your cluster.

### 2. **Install Helm (Optional)**

If you're using Helm for deploying applications, you can install Helm for easier management of Kubernetes resources.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

### 3. **Prepare Docker Images**

Dagster components like the web UI (Dagit) and the workers need to run as containers in Kubernetes. You need to build and push Docker images for your pipeline code to a container registry (Docker Hub, GCR, or any other).

For example, you can create a `Dockerfile` for your Dagster repository:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install dagster dagit dagster-k8s dagster-docker

# Copy your Dagster repository
COPY . /opt/dagster/repo

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /opt/dagster/repo

# Set up the default entry point
CMD ["dagit", "-h", "0.0.0.0", "-p", "3000"]
```

Build and push the image:

```bash
docker build -t <your-repo>:<tag> .
docker push <your-repo>:<tag>
```

### 4. **Install Dagster on Kubernetes**

You can deploy Dagster components on Kubernetes using the official Helm chart or by defining Kubernetes YAML manifests manually.

#### Option 1: Helm Chart Deployment

Dagster provides an official Helm chart to simplify the deployment process.

Add the Helm chart repository:

```bash
helm repo add dagster https://dagster-io.github.io/helm
helm repo update
```

Install Dagster using Helm:

```bash
helm install dagster dagster/dagster \
  --set dagit.image.repository=<your-repo> \
  --set dagit.image.tag=<tag> \
  --set userDeployments.enabled=true \
  --set userDeployments.deployments[0].image.repository=<your-repo> \
  --set userDeployments.deployments[0].image.tag=<tag>
```

This will install the Dagit web UI, the scheduler, and user code deployments.

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment with YAML

You can also manually define and apply Kubernetes resources, including Deployments, Services, and Job/Worker configurations. Here's an example manifest for Dagit:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dagit
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dagit
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dagit
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dagit
          image: <your-repo>:<tag>
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dagit
spec:
  selector:
    app: dagit
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f dagit-deployment.yaml
```

### 5. **Set Up Dagster Executors**

Dagster uses executors to run pipeline steps, and you can configure Kubernetes-based executors. This allows you to execute pipeline tasks on K8s pods.

You can configure the KubernetesExecutor in your Dagster repository:

```python
from dagster_k8s.executor import k8s_job_executor
from dagster import pipeline, solid

@solid
def my_solid(context):
    context.log.info("Running solid")

@pipeline(mode_defs=[ModeDefinition(executor_defs=[k8s_job_executor])])
def my_pipeline():
    my_solid()
```

Make sure to set the executor in your Dagster configuration.

### 6. **Access Dagit and Schedule Pipelines**

Once deployed, you can access Dagit (Dagster's web UI) via a LoadBalancer or NodePort service, depending on your Kubernetes configuration. You can use Dagit to trigger pipeline runs, set schedules, and monitor execution.

For example, if using a LoadBalancer:

```bash
kubectl get svc dagit
```

You will see the external IP of the service where you can access Dagit.

### 7. **Monitoring and Scaling**

Monitor your pipelines using tools like `kubectl logs` to check the logs of your Dagit and worker pods. You can also scale the deployments for high availability or larger workloads by increasing the number of replicas.

With these steps, you should be able to deploy and run a Dagster data pipeline on Kubernetes. Let me know if you need more specific details or configurations!
